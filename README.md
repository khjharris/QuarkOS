# QuarkOS
Operating System for the Discontinued Intel Quark (Curie) - A pentium based microprocessor.

Will eventually be ported to work with single core pentiums, with hopefully multicore variants produced eventually.

## Notes:
In order to pull the grub submodule run `git submodle update --init --recursive`
